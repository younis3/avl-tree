# avl-tree
 Ex4 of the Java OOP course


## File description
- AvlTree.java - An implementation of the AVL tree data structure.
- Node.java - This class represents a Node in the AVL Tree
____________________


## Design
AvlTree class implements the interface Iterable<Integer>  
Node class represents a single Node in the tree
____________________


## Implementation details
The class Node which represents a node in the tree to help my implementaion of the AVL data structure  
which includes:  
- getters and setters for the node's data (children, parent, value)
- methods to check for height and balancing
- findMinVal method which returns the Node with the minimum value in the tree
- contains method which checks if a given value is in the tree
- searchInt method  which searches for the node that has the same value 
- and a method that returns a successor node
